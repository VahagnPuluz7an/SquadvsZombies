2023, Helix Studio Assets© 
==========================

Thanks for your purchase(s)! :)

All models are set in the prefabs. You will find them in the "Prefabs" folder.
Prefabs are distributed in subfolders according to the shader used. In the package you will find prefabs with paid shader “Stylized Toony Shader” as an example. You can read more about this shaders at the link:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/stylized-toony-shader-161170

Each model is represented by two prefabs (Standard Unity Shader and paid Stylized Toony Shader) with different shaders as an example.
All you need to do is to add the prefab to the scene.

It is especially worth paying attention to some models:
A sniper rifle (indices 08-10) that has a tripod that can be deployed to the angle you want.
Pivots are set according to the logic of using models.
